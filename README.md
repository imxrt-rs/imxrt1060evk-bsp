# NXP i.MX RT 1060 Evaluation Kit Board Support

Provides the needed setup to create applications on the 1060 evaluation kit.

Most of the examples run now though require a segger jlink to run them. The i2c
and spi examples have not yet been fleshed out and tested yet.

## Examples

See the README in the examples directory for example usage.
